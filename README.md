# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design


The client, DriverPass, wanted a new system to provide better driver training for their customers. The system should allow customers to take online classes and practice tests and provide on-the-road training if they want. The system should also allow the owner to access data from anywhere, online or offline, and download reports and information that can be worked on at home. Security is a concern, and different employees at DriverPass need different rights and roles. The system should have tracking functionality to monitor changes made to the system and produce an activity report.

I think that the second project was done very well and had clear representation of the sytem for the customer. I made sure to not use technical words so the presentation was easy to understand from all audiences. This presentation will help in confirming the system with the client and make sure all their needs are successfully met. However, on my first project I would change the requirements and make sure that I include the correct functional and non-functional requirements for the system, and the right limitations. 

Interpreting user needs involves understanding the requirements and goals of the user and translating them into a system design that addresses those needs effectively. This process typically involves analyzing user feedback, conducting user research, and considering usability factors. By understanding the user's needs, we can create systems that are intuitive, efficient, and capable of solving the user's problems.
Considering the user's needs when designing software is crucial for several reasons:
User satisfaction: By incorporating user needs, software can be designed to provide a positive user experience, leading to greater user satisfaction and adoption.
Usability: Understanding user needs helps in designing software that is intuitive, easy to use, and efficient, reducing the learning curve and potential frustrations for users.
Relevance: Taking into account user needs ensures that the software addresses the specific problems and requirements of the target audience, making it more relevant and valuable.
Adoption and engagement: Software that meets user needs is more likely to be adopted and actively used, leading to higher user engagement and better overall system performance.

When approaching software design, there are various techniques and strategies that can be employed. Here are a few that I have used:
User-centered design: This approach involves actively involving users throughout the design process, conducting user research, gathering feedback, and iterating on the design based on user input.
Requirement analysis: Thoroughly analyzing user requirements and documenting them helps ensure that the system design aligns with the desired functionality and scope.
Iterative design: Breaking down the design process into iterative cycles enables designers to refine and improve the system progressively based on user feedback and evolving needs.

In the future I would consider Design Thinking as well. Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that emphasizes empathy, understanding user needs, and iterative prototyping. It involves a human-centered approach to design, encouraging designers to deeply understand users and their contexts to create innovative solutions.
